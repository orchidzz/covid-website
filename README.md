# covid-website

Website of covid world total recoveries, cases, deaths based on dates. Interactive with zooming and clicking on graph to display the numbers. Used beautiful-soup to scrape data, matplotlib to graph, mpld3 to embed graph in website, and python flask server. website and postgres database hosted on heroku. updates graph daily at 7:30 am utc or 11:30 pm pst

First, scraped data from two different sources, then scrape daily on worldometers --> data are not completely accurate and should only be used to see the bigger trend. 

Note: website is down due to Heroku now requiring paid supscription for previously free products.
