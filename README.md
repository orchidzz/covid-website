# covid-website

website of covid world total recoveries, cases, deaths bases on dates. Interactive with zooming and clicking on graph to display the numbers. Used beautiful soup to scrape data, matplotlib to graph, mpld3 to embed graph in website, and python flask server. website and postgres databse hosted on heroku. updates graph daily at 7:30 am utc or 11:30 pm pst

first, scraped data from two different sources, then scrape daily on worldometers --> data are not completely accurate and should only be used to see the bigger trend.
